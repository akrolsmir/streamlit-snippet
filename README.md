# About

Hey! Use Streamlit Snippets to try out simple scripts in your browser, save your
work, and share it with others!

# TODOs

- Split out network/misc calls into utils.py
- Figure out why second click "share" click invariably fails
- Generate a parameter or option to view without the execbox
- Clean up URL via redirect? Add Notion-style title?
  - Is there a good way of getting the full URL from Streamlit?
  - Want http://snippet.streamlit.io/?s=Example-bar-chart-iI0cMzhy
- List all snippets and allow people to click on them
- Start versioning this? (Eh, probably with the migration to streamlit GH org)
